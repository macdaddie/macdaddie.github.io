= Building a Gigabyte Brix SUSE Distro

. Download the latest copy of SUSE link:https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed[tumbleweed]
. Burn this ISO image to thumb drive

[source,sh]
----
dd if=<location_of_iso> of=/dev/rdisk<thumbdrive_disk_number> bs=1m
----

. Put this in the front USB slot of the Brix
. Power off and power on (a hard reboot is important)
. Press the delete key repeatedly to get to Brix BIOS
. Change boot order in boot section to specify USB drive as 1st boot
. Save and Exit (reboot on thumb drive)
. Run installer

== Enable SSH

*(if it's not installed)*

[source,sh]
----
sudo zypper refresh
sudo zypper install --no-confirm openssh

sudo systemctl start sshd
sudo systemctl enable sshd
----

=== Firewall

==== Allow SSH

[source,sh]
----
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
----

==== Allow Web

== Configuring GRUB for Headless Boot

Edit `/etc/default/grub`

Change `GRUB_TERMINAL="gfxterm"` to `GRUB_TERMINAL="console"`

Run

[source,sh]
----
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
----

== Apache

=== Installing Apache

[source,sh]
----
zypper in apache2
----

=== Configuring Apache

- Document root can be found in `/etc/apache2/default-server.conf` and by default is `/srv/www/htdocs`
- Add your websites as separate folders to this location e.g., `mkdir -p /srv/www/htdocs/mywebsite`

By default, Apache denies access to all files. Don't edit the http.conf file directly; rather, create a default virtual host file in the `vhosts.d` directory that sends all traffic to the default location (`/srv/www/htdocs/mywebsite`). If in the future you add multiple sites, then this is the file to edit and add new sites here.

The way I did it was to `cd` to `/etc/apache2/vhosts.d` and

[source,sh]
----
cp vhost.template _default_vhost.conf
----

(`vhost.conf` files are loaded automatically in name order, so the `_default_vhost.conf` file name virtually guarantees it will be the first one)

I then edited the `_default_vhost.conf` and changed the placeholders for the domain and the document root for my domain and my document root of `/srv/www/htdocs/mywebsite`.

Be sure to scan the whole file for any other paths where you could insert `/srv/www/htdocs/mywebsite` as there are a couple.

Then restart Apache with

[source,sh]
----
systemctl restart apache2
----

This worked for me.
